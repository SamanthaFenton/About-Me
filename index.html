            <h3>A Brief History of Samantha</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in deepest darkest Norfolk, Samantha began life in a small village called South Wootton just on the outskirts of the historic town of Kings Lynn.  Village life was very fun for a young Sam who spent most of her free time exploring the surrounding countryside and woodlands, and was often found (when not exploring the nearby castle, Castle Rising) river swimming at nearby Babbingley.  Being so close to the coast she also spent lots of her time sailing, canoeing and bodyboarding.  During the holidays she was found working at the beach cafe, after a morning swim in the sea.
                Samantha was always very active and participated in many different sporting events.  After schooling Samantha pursued her education in Art whilst working various different jobs, first in Cambridge, then Exeter, then Leeds and finally returning to `sunny' Norfolk in 2006, where she now lives and continues to reside in the, `fair city,' of Norwich
